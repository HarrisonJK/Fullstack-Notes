# Problem Solving Patterns
[â¬… Go Back](../algos.md)

## REACTO
### **R**epeat the problem
  - Understand the problem
  - Restate the problem in own words
  - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
  - What are the outputs that come from the solution?
  - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information to solve the problem?)
  - How to label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem
### **E**xamples
  - Start with simple examples
  - Progress to more complex examples
  - Explore edge cases / invalid inputs
### **A**pproach
  - Break it down - explicitly write out steps to take
  - Psuedocode
### **C**ode
  - Solve or simplify problem
  - Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
    - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    - Write a simplified solution
    - Incorporate difficulty back in
### **O**ptimize code
  - Look back and refactor
  - Can you check the result?
  - Can you derive the result differently?
  - Can you understand it at a glance?
  - Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
  - Can you improve the performance of your solution?
  - Can you think of other ways to refactor?
  - How have other people solved this problem?

## Frequency Counters
- This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- This can often avoid the need for nested loops of O(n^2) operations with arrays / strings
