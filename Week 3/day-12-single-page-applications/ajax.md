# Single-Page Applications and AJAX
Asynchronous Javascript and XML
 - JSON took over so it should be Asynchronous Javascript and Json (AJAJ)


## Notes
- Single Page Application (SPA)
- Dynamically rewrites/modifies current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server!
    - It doesn't load a new page every single time
- No reload/refresh within user interface
- Javascript manipulates the DOM
- Essentially works like a desktop application

### Notes from Demo
`form.addEventListener('submit', ...)` submit is a special event listener for forms

`event.preventDefault()` prevents page from refreshing
